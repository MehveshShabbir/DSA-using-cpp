# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! This collection of code implementations covers fundamental DSA concepts and problems, providing a hands-on approach to understanding how these structures and algorithms work.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Single_linked**: ➖ Implementation of singly linked lists with basic operations.
- **Double_linked**: 🔄 Implementation of a doubly linked list with node and list management functionalities.
- **Josephus_Problem**: 🎯 Classic Josephus problem solved using circular linked lists.
- **Stack**: 🥞 Stack operations, including infix to postfix conversion.
- **Queue**: 🚶‍♂️ Queue implementations using arrays, linked lists, and templates.
- **Heap**: 🔢 Min and max heap implementations, including insertion and binary sorting.
Tree: 🌲 Basic tree structures and traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: 📊 Graph representations and algorithms, including BFS, DFS, adjacency matrices, and more.
- **AVL_Tree**: 🌳 Self-balancing binary search tree (BST) with AVL tree operations like insertion.
