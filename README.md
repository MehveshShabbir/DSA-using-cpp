# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Labs

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab repository! This collection of code implementations covers fundamental DSA concepts and problems, providing a hands-on approach to understanding how these structures and algorithms work.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

- **AVL_Tree**: 🌳 Self-balancing binary search tree (BST) with AVL tree operations like insertion.
- **Double_linked**: 🔄 Implementation of a doubly linked list with node and list management functionalities.
- **Graphs**: 📊 Graph representations and algorithms, including BFS, DFS, adjacency matrices, and more.
- **Heap**: 🔢 Min and max heap implementations, including insertion and binary sorting.
- **Josephus_Problem**: 🎯 Classic Josephus problem solved using circular linked lists.
- **Queue**: 🚶‍♂️ Queue implementations using arrays, linked lists, and templates.
- **Single_linked**: ➖ Implementation of singly linked lists with basic operations.
- **Stack**: 🥞 Stack operations, including infix to postfix conversion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Labs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired lab directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Labs/AVL_Tree
   ```
3. Compile and run the code:
   ```bash
   g++ insertion.cpp -o insertion
   ./insertion
   ```

- **Adjacency_list.cpp**: Implementation of graph using an adjacency list.
- **BFS.cpp**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse or search tree or graph data structures.
- **DFS.cpp**: Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm implementation.
- **DirectedMatrix.cpp**: Represents a directed graph using an adjacency matrix.
- **UndirectedMatrix.cpp**: Represents an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix.

### Heap 🔢
- **BinSort.cpp**: Binary sorting using heaps.
- **InsertionMax.cpp**: Code to insert elements into a max heap.
